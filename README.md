Project Description for GitHub Repository: Magic 8 Ball
Project Title: Magic 8 Ball

Description: This project implements a simple Magic 8 Ball game using Python, showcasing my understanding of basic programming concepts covered in the Programming Software Solutions course. The program allows users to ask yes-or-no questions and receive random responses, simulating the classic toy's functionality.

Key Features:

 - User Input: The program prompts the user to enter a yes-or-no question.
 - Random Responses: Utilizes the random module to select from a predefined list of possible answers, demonstrating knowledge of lists and randomization in Python.
 - Looping: Implements a while loop to allow continuous questioning until the user decides to exit the program, highlighting control flow in Python.
 - Basic Error Handling: Checks for empty questions and allows the user to exit gracefully.

Learning Outcomes: Through this project, I have reinforced my skills in:

 - Understanding user input and output in Python.
 - Utilizing data structures like lists to store multiple responses.
 - Applying control flow techniques to manage program execution.
 - Writing clean and maintainable code that enhances user interaction.
 - 
This project serves as a practical application of the programming concepts learned in class and demonstrates my ability to develop interactive Python applications.
